Debugging Laravel issues can be free, simple and elegant. There are many third party services out there that will help you plug ugly error logs into an application that breaks it down into meaningful bits. Today we'll talk about a quick integration of Sentry. There are many other error logging platforms that require an almost identical setup. Let's dive in...

#### Step 1. (Sign up for an account)
Go to sentry.io and setup an account.

Create a Laravel project and copy the DSN to your clipboard.


#### Step 2. (Install the package)
In you laravel application, run the following command.
~~~bash
composer require sentry/sentry-laravel
~~~

#### Step 3. (Add .env variables)
~~~bash
SENTRY_DSN='INSERT DSN FROM SENTYR.IO HERE'
~~~

#### Step 4. (Add to Error Reporter)
~~~php

public function boot() {
  report($e);
}
~~~

#### Step 5. Watch the errors show up!
